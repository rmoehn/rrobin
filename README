Rrobin version 0.001
====================

Rrobin is a GUI program for managing tournaments.

One can register all the playing persons and assign them to groups.
Rrobin will generate pairings so that each player in the group will
play against all the other players in that group (round robin). When
you give the results of the games to Rrobin, it will compute a ranking
of the players.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Build.PL

Notes concerning the tests:

 - The run of ./Build test will take some time as Myrtscht is
   started and then killed after one second repeatedly.

 - During the tests the main window of Myrtscht will show up
   repeatedly for about one second. - That is normal. There is only a
   problem when the window does not disappear within 5 seconds.
